## Frupal - Energy feature

At a minimum, download the data (a .txt file) and the executable (main) 

To execute:

```bash
./main
```
This simply allows you to see how much energy hero currently has.

```bash
./main sub somenumber
```
This subtract's somenumber(an arbitrary integer) from the total amount of energy the hero currently has.

```bash
./main reset somenumber
```
This sets/resets the total amount of energy to somenumber (arbitrary integer).

To see this guide in the command line interface:

```bash
./main help
```
