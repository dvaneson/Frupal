## Pushing code to the master branch

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "The feature I added"
git push -u origin master
```

This will
1) Stage all the changed files
2) Commit the staged files for pushing
3) Push the changes to the repository


## Getting the latest code from master

```bash
git pull origin master
```

Assuming you have no merge conflicts, this will give you the latest code from the master branch
